CYOA - Tudor History: Henry VIII and his marital life
Overview: This project is an interactive narrative created using Twine. It explores the events of Henry VIII's reign, focusing on his marital decisions and how they impact or could impact the Tudor dynasty and England's religious and political landscape based on what you choose to do throughout the story. Through a series of choices, the player takes on the role of Henry VIII and navigates the dilemmas he faced, such as his desire for a male heir, his relationships with his wives, and his break from the Catholic Church. The story is designed with multiple branching paths that allow the player to explore different historical outcomes, some accurate, others imaginary based on what I, the creator of the narrative believe would've happened if the choices were made.
The narrative offers several alternative final endings, allowing for replayability.
The narrative has one historically accurate path from which inaccurate branching was made.
Some moments in the story are enhanced with imagery.
Some moments are enhanced by conditionals that lead towards a different path an example is whether Henry seeks an annulment from Katherine of Aragon.
The game tracks variables such as the success or failure of Henry's attempts to produce a male heir.
